# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-diagnosis-using-InceptionV3-
This project implements a deep learning model to classify tomato leaf diseases using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 architecture. By leveraging a custom dataset and fine-tuning pretrained weights, the model accurately identifies six classes of plant leaf conditionsâ€”including common diseases and healthy leaves
